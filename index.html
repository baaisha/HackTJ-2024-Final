                    <strong>What is statistics?</strong> Statistics is the science of learning from data. Data is always collected in context.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Data origins:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Data comes from real-world contexts.</li>
                        <li>A variable is a characteristic of something that can be assigned a number or category.</li>
                        <li>The thing in which the category or number is assigned is called the observational unit. It is the objects or people that data is being collected from.</li>
                        <li>Variability is different variables taking on different values from observational unit to observational unit. Statistics would not be a thing if there was no variability.</li>
                        <li>Quantitative variable measures a numerical characteristic.</li>
                        <li>Categorical variable records a group designation; binary variables are categorical variables with only two possible categories.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>Research questions:</strong> A research question often looks for patterns in different variables and looks for relationships between variables.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Visualizations:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Dotplot:</strong> Graphs a quantitative variable. Each quantitative data value is shown as a dot above its location on a number line. Draw a horizontal number line with the variable name. Scale the axis by looking at the minimum and maximum values. Mark a dot above the location of horizontal axis for each observational unit.</li>
                        <li><strong>Bar graph:</strong> Used to display data from a categorical variable or compare the size of different quantities (bars are not touching). Label both axes (categorical variable on the x-axis and quantitative data value on the y-axis). Draw bars that correspond to each variable and leave room in between each bar.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>Tips:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dotplots and bar graphs are most illuminating when comparing the distribution of a variable between two or more groups.</li>
                        <li>When comparing tendency, do not use the word greater or less than, simply compare the values.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>Concepts:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Tendency:</strong> Refers to the center of the distribution and where the data points are likely to fall.</li>
                        <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Refers to the spread/range of the distribution (synonymous with spread, variability) and how likely the data points are to fall within a certain range.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>Questions to ponder:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What does each dot in a dot plot represent?</li>
                        <li>What type of variable is displayed in dot plots? What type of variable is displayed in bar graphs?</li>
                        <li>When are dot plots and bar graphs most illuminating?</li>
                        <li>What is consistency and tendency? How are they different?</li>
                    </ul>

                    </ul>
                    <strong>Questions to Consider:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What is another word for consistency? Another word for tendency?<br>Spread<br>Center</li>
                        <li>If the right half of a graph looks like its left, what shape could the graph be?<br>Symmetric mound shaped<br>Bimodal (two mounds on either side)</li>
                        <li>If the tail of a distribution extends to the larger values on the right side of the axis, what shape is it said to have? What would an example look like? Vice versa?<br>It is said to have a shape of right skewed. The skewness is in the direction of the tail<br>An example would look like a mound left of the middle of the graph that extends to the right<br>A left skewed graph would be a tail on the left that makes its way to a peak on the right half of the graph</li>
                        <li>Can a distribution be symmetric if it has more than one peak?<br>Yes, it can be a symmetric bimodal graph</li>
                        <li>What are data values that differ markedly from the pattern established by the vast majority of the data?<br>Outliers are data points that stand out especially from a distribution</li>
                        <li>What are mean and median in your own words? What type of variable(s) can it be applied to?<br>Mean is the arithmetic average and median is the positional center<br>Mean and median can only be applied to categorical variables</li>
                        <li>What symbol is used to represent a population mean (a parameter)? What symbol is used to represent a sample mean (a statistic)? Can each of these values be represented by mean or median values?<br>Population mean is denoted as 𝝻<br>Sample mean is denoted as x̄<br>Both parameters and statistics can be described through mean and median</li>
                        <li>Can mode apply to categorical data?<br>Mode can be applied to categorical data as it is the data point repeated the most</li>
                        <li>What measure of spread is resistant to outliers? What measure of center is resistant to outliers?<br>The measure of spread resistant to outliers is IQR as it only accounts for the 50% and not the possibly skewed ends<br>The measure of center resistant to outliers is median as it does not account for the ends of the distribution</li>
                        <li>What is a property defined as versus a measurement?<br>Center would be an example of a property as it is something that describes a distribution overall as a broad term. Median, for example, would be a measurement of center as it involves a specified value.</li>
                        <li>What features are not indicated by the center?<br>You cannot determine the spread of a distribution through only its center</li>
                        <li>How many data points are in each quartile of a boxplot?<br>A quarter of the data is in each quartile</li>
                        <li>True or False: The median of a distribution is 100 and the IQR is 50. The middle 50% of data is in the range of 75-125.<br>False because the quartiles separate data points but not all quartiles have the same range in between them.</li>

                    <strong>Standard Deviation:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Standard deviation is a measure of spread, based on deviations from the mean in a dataset.</li>
                        <li>The standard deviation approximates the average distance of the observations from their mean.</li>
                        <li>Notated with σ for a population, and Sx for a sample.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>Calculating Standard Deviation:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>List the deviations (distance from the mean) from the mean for all data values.</li>
                        <li>Square the deviations.</li>
                        <li>Sum the squares.</li>
                        <li>Divide by the number of data points (if a population), or the number of data points - 1 (n-1) (if a sample).</li>
                        <li>Take the square root.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <strong>Note:</strong> Standard deviations must be positive (squaring in step 2). Variance = SD^2.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Other Points:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The higher the standard deviation, the more the data tends to be away from the mean (?).</li>
                        <li>When a dataset has an odd number of observations, do not include the median in either the lower or upper half of the data for calculating quartiles.</li>
                        <li>Range and IQR are not intervals of values, but a single number that measures the spread of the distribution (oops).</li>
                        <li>Measures of spread only apply to quantitative variables, not categorical ones.</li>
                        <li>Of the measures of center, range and standard deviation are not resistant, while IQR is.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>Comparing Standard Deviations:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Out of data set A and B, B would have the greater standard deviation as more points are farther away from the center compared to A which has much more data at its center.</li>
                        <li>C and D would have equal standard deviations as one is just a reflection of another along the same median.</li>
                        <li>We can tell from data set E that only a small percentage of its points are near its median, which is a dead giveaway that the standard deviation is greater. Also, D has a lot of concentrated points relatively near its center.</li>

                    <strong>Guidelines for Graph Selection and Analysis:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Choose an appropriate graph for your data (boxplot, dot plot, stemplot, histogram, bar graph).</li>
                        <li>Label title, axes, scale, and measurement units.</li>
                        <li>C-SOCS-C:</li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>Context:</strong> What is the data representing?
                    <br>
                    <strong>Shape:</strong> Is it symmetric mound, bimodal, skewed right, skewed left, or uniform?
                    <br>
                    <strong>Outliers:</strong> Are any points clearly away from the majority of the data? Describe whether there are outliers or not. Write out calculations using Q1-1.5IQR and Q3+1.5IQR.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Center:</strong> Choose the best measure of center that typifies the data (mean or median).
                    <br>
                    <strong>Spread:</strong> Choose the best measure of spread that shows the variability of the data.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Conclusion:</strong> What is the typical observational unit like?
                    <br>
                    <strong>Note:</strong> When comparing two graphs, if one has an outlier, you need to use median as a measure of center and IQR as a measure of spread because they are resistant to both of those and you want to compare the same types of spread and center.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Additional Tips:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make sure you include the observational units, variables, why data was gathered, when it was gathered, how it was gathered, where it was gathered, and by whom it was gathered in the context (or at least as much as possible).</li>
                        <li>When comparing two distributions, make sure to describe how they are similar and how they are different.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>Example Walkthrough:</strong>
                    <br>
                    In 1846, a published paper provided chest measurements (in inches) of 5738 Scottish militiamen. This table displays the data in summary form using a frequency list. A count of 3 means there are 3 Scottish militiamen with the corresponding chest size, 33 inches for example. The second row means there are 18 Scottish militiamen with a chest size of 34 inches. Make a histogram of the data. If the technology you are using doesn’t allow you to use a frequency list, here is the complete distribution: Scottish (you can copy all the values by clicking at the top of the column, then right-clicking and choosing copy). Be sure to label the histogram. Then, describe the distribution using SOCS.

                    <strong>Looking at Two Quantitative Variables:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Explanatory (independent) and response (dependent) variables.</li>
                        <li>Explanatory is the one modified to see the change in response variable.</li>
                        <li>Simplest graph for graphing two quantitative variables is a scatterplot.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>Scatterplot Graphing:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Put the explanatory variable on the x-axis and the response on the y (make sure to include units and scale axes as necessary).</li>
                        <li>Place a dot for each data point at the corresponding x and y coordinates.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>Note:</strong> If it is described as "___ vs ___", it is always y vs x.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Examining a Scatter Plot:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Direction: Whether the graph has a rough positive or negative slope (up or down as it moves to the right).</li>
                        <li>Form: How the graph looks (approximately), found by examining the graph visually; e.g., linear, curved, etc.</li>
                        <li>Strength: How strictly the points follow a clear pattern or form; usually strong, moderate, or weak.</li>
                        <li>Outliers: Points that fall outside the defined pattern.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>Template Sentence:</strong> "The scatterplot reveals a [strength], [direction], [form] association between [explanatory] and [response]."
                    <br>
                    <strong>Correlation Coefficient:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/2021/guesscorrelation/GuessCorrelation.html">Correlation coefficient applet</a>.</li>
                        <li>Usually denoted by r.</li>
                        <li>A value between -1 and 1 inclusive that shows the strength and direction of a possible linear relationship.</li>
                        <li>The sign of r gives the direction (positive or negative) of the linear relationship; 0 being a flat line.</li>
                        <li>The closer |r| is to 1, the stronger the relationship, the closer to 0 the weaker.</li>
                        <li>If it is exactly -1 or 1, the scatterplot is an exact line.</li>
                        <li>Note: This does not necessarily mean there is a cause/effect relationship between the variables.</li>
                        <li>Note: Even if |r| is very close to 1, it does not necessarily mean the best relationship is linear.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>Questions:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What axis is the explanatory variable placed on? Response variable?<br>The explanatory variable is always placed on the x-axis.<br>The response variable is always placed on the y-axis.</li>
                        <li>If a scatterplot is described as weight vs. height, what variables are put on each axis?<br>Height is an explanatory variable for weight as height is set and influences weight. This, in turn, leaves height on the x-axis and weight on the y-axis.</li>
                        <li>What type of association does the correlation coefficient measure?<br>It measures the linear association. Even if a coefficient is extremely close to 1 or -1, it does not mean it is linear.</li>
                        <li>If r is near -1 or 1, can you draw a cause and effect relationship?<br>No, you cannot draw a cause and effect relationship off of only a regression coefficient.</li>

                        <li>Regression (unlike correlation) requires an explanatory and response variable.</li>
                        <li>A regression line is a model for the data.</li>
                        <li>A regression line relating y to x has an equation of the form ŷ = a + bx (slope-intercept goes crazy), where:</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>ŷ (y-hat) is the predicted value of the response variable, y, for a given value of the explanatory variable, x.</li>
                        <li>b is the slope, the amount by which y is predicted to change when x increases by 1 unit (omg algebra moment).</li>
                        <li>a is the y-intercept.</li>

                    <strong>Extrapolation:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Extrapolation is the use of a regression line for predictions outside the intervals of values x that were used to obtain the line.</li>

                        <li>The LSRL is the line that makes the sum of the squared residuals as small as possible.</li>
                        <li>Note: The residual is found by the equation ŷ = observed y - predicted y.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>Important Notes:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Do not confuse a slope coefficient with a correlation coefficient or you’re actually trash.</li>
                        <li>Use good statistical notation when writing the equation of an LSRL.</li>
                        <li>Use variable names instead of generic x and y.</li>
                        <li>Put a hat on the y variable.</li>
                        <li>List the intercept first and slope second, a + bx (ok maybe not slope-intercept oops).</li>
                        <li>Observations with extreme x values have the potential to be influential, but if their y values are consistent with the pattern, they won’t be.</li>
                        <li>Check for influential observations by removing the datapoint and seeing how the LSRL changes.</li>
                        <li>r^2 (residuals squared) is the proportion of the variability in the y-variable explained by the x-variable.</li>
                        <li>When interpreting slope, say the average or predicted change in y, not the actual change.</li>

                    <strong>Types of Bias:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Convenience sampling: Only choosing people convenient to get.</li>
                        <li>Voluntary response sampling: Letting people choose to be part of the sample or not.</li>
                        <li>Undercoverage bias: The way you choose your sample underrepresents a part of the population.</li>
                        <li>Non-response bias: When people selected as part of the sample refuse.</li>
                        <li>Response bias: The way you survey or select the sample influences responses.</li>
                        <li>Wording bias: Confusing wording leads to confusion.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>Lurking Variables:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Definition: A variable that could influence the response variable, yet is not the explanatory variable.</li>

                    <strong>Sampling Bias:</strong> When a sample of a population is collected in a way all members of the population do not have an equal sampling probability (chance of being sampled).
                    <br>
                    <strong>Simple Random Sampling:</strong> A type of probability sampling in which a subset of a population is randomly selected for data collection. All members of the population must have an equal chance of being sampled.
                    <br>
                    Random digit tables, calculators, and computers are good impersonal methods to select a random sample.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Using a Random Digits Table:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Decide the number of digits being looked for each time.</li>
                        <li>When under 10 items in the population, look for single digits (0-9).</li>
                        <li>When under 100 items, look for 2 digits (00-99).</li>
                        <li>When under 1000 items, look for 3 digits (000-999).</li>
                        <li>Start at any point in the table and read the digits based on the number decided in step 1. E.g., if a population has 78 items, look for digits 01-78 (skip 00 and 79-99).</li>
                        <li>Depending on the situation, you might skip repeat selections. Show your work by circling/underlining digits being selected and crossing out digits being skipped.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>Sample Size:</strong> Refers to how many observational units are in a sample.
                    <br>
                    In an actual study, you should only take one sample from a given population. If your sampling method is biased, taking a larger sample will not reduce the bias, but produce a more precise estimate that is still inaccurate to the population value.
                    <br>
                    If you are working with a truly random sample, it is reasonable to draw conclusions about a population from its sample. The larger a sample, the more precise its statistics are. Precision is how close the data points are to each other. Sample size affects the precision of a sample. Accuracy is how close the data points are to the accepted/predicted value. Bias (or the lack of bias) affects the accuracy of a sample.
                    <br>
                    <strong>If you are not working with a random sample, what can you not do confidently?</strong> You cannot say that the sample is representative of the population.
                    <br>
                    <strong>If your sampling method is biased and you take a larger sample you will _____ reduce the bias and you will produce a more _____ estimate that is still not close to the population value.</strong>

                    <strong>Anecdotal Evidence:</strong> Results of situations that come to mind easily, but have little to no use in scientific research. Statistics tries to avoid anecdotal evidence.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Experiment:</strong> Study where treatment is actively imposed by the experimenter on subjects. Ideally, subjects are all identical other than the explanatory variable.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Random Assignment:</strong> Preferred way of assigning subjects treatment to avoid confounding variables. Each subject has an equal chance of being assigned any treatment group. Study is called a randomized comparative experiment.
                    <br>
                    It is often helpful to diagram an experiment using an experimental design diagram.
                    <br>
                    Observational unit --> (arrows from observational to treatment indicate random assignment) --> Treatment 1 or Treatment 2 --> Compare results (mean or proportion).
                    <br>
                    <strong>Comparison:</strong> Use a design to compare two or more treatments.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Random Assignment:</strong> Use chance to assign experimental units to treatments to create roughly equivalent groups of observational units by balancing the effects of other variables among treatment groups.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Control:</strong> Keeps other variables (excluding explanatory) the same for all groups, especially variables that are likely to affect the response variable.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Replication:</strong> Uses enough experimental units in each group so that any difference in the effects of the treatments can be distinguished from chance difference between groups.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Blindness:</strong> Experimental units are not aware of the experiment being done and the group that they are assigned to avoid outside influences.

                    <strong>3 Easy Steps to Fix Your Confounding Variables!!!</strong>
                    <br>
                    Are you running a medical survey or similar? Worried about dumb patients "feeling better" just because they got "helped"? Try placebos! Make everyone feel the same way by changing as little as possible between control groups.
                    <br>
                    Stupid patients and researchers letting judgment get in the way? Blind them!!! Don’t tell patients which control group they're part of (single blind), and now that I think about it don’t tell researchers either (double blind).
                    <br>
                    Really paranoid about a specific confounding variable??? Block them!!! Separate your observational units into homogeneous blocks by lurking variables first, then randomize groups and compare within each block - no more confounding guaranteed!
                    <br>
                    Um yeah infomercial done.
                    <br>
                    A design without blocking is a "completely randomized design".
                    <br>
                    A design with blocking is a "randomized block design".
                    <br>
                    One sample, two sample, matched pairs.
                    <br>
                    <strong>One sample:</strong> Collect one piece of data (one sample wow) from each observational unit, then see if the sample statistics show anything meaningfully significant (1 sample test).
                    <br>
                    <strong>Two sample:</strong> Split your observational units into groups then take a piece of data from each group, but calculate statistics for each group. Compare to see if there is a significant difference between the two (2 sample test).
                    <br>
                    <strong>Matched pairs:</strong> Collect two pieces of data from the same observational unit (usually an intrinsically paired observational unit or a before and after type situation). Analyze the differences between the two pieces of data as a statistic for significance (paired test).
                    <br>
                    <strong>What does blocking eliminate in an experiment?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Blocking helps eliminate confounding variables.

                    <strong>Probability:</strong> Measures how likely it is for an event to occur.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Theoretical vs. Empirical Probability:</strong> Theoretical probability is based on the assumption that all outcomes have an equal chance of occurring, while empirical probability is based on actual experimental data observations.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Sample Space:</strong> The set S of all possible outcomes of an experiment.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Event:</strong> Any subset of a sample space.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Probability Formula:</strong> In a sample space with equally likely outcomes, the probability of an event E is defined as: P(E) = n(E)/n(S), where P(E) is the probability of E and n(X) is the number of X.

                    <strong>Organization Tools and Diagrams:</strong>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Tables:</strong> A way to organize sample spaces and outcomes. Useful for examining the relationship between 2 categorical variables by displaying every possible outcome.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Trees:</strong> Most useful when there is a sequence of events. Branches are created for each next possible event, and if the branch segments have equal chance, the probability can be determined by counting.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Venn Diagrams:</strong> Made up of 2 or more circles, showing the relationship between events. Components include Rectangle S (the sample space) and Circles A and B (specific events in the sample space).
                    <br>
                    <strong>English Probability:</strong> The English word "not" involves complements and is designated Ac or A', "and" involves set intersection, and "or" involves set union.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Probability vs. Statistics:</strong> Probability asks about the chance of something specific happening given the possibilities, while statistics involves drawing a sample, describing it, and making inferences about the population based on the sample information.

                    <strong>1. Mutually Exclusive</strong>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Definition 0.1:</strong> We call two events mutually exclusive if they have no chance of occurring at the same time. More formally, A and B are mutually exclusive if P(A ∩ B) = 0.
                    <br>
                    This is significant, as it allows us to simplify probabilities just from the fact that two events are mutually exclusive. The following theorem applies if and only if events A and B are mutually exclusive.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Theorem 0.2. Addition of Mutually Exclusive Events:</strong> P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B)
                    <br>
                    <strong>Example 0.3.</strong> Find the probability that a twenty-sided die rolls a prime number or a multiple of four.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Walkthrough:</strong>
                    <br>
                    (a) Are these events mutually exclusive?
                    <br>
                    (b) Use the theorem above.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Definition 0.4:</strong> If an event B occurs with different probability when an event A occurs than when A doesn’t, it is said that B is dependent on A. More formally, A and B are dependent if P(A) ≠ P(A|B).
                    <br>
                    <strong>Definition 0.5:</strong> If the inverse of this (if B happens with the same probability regardless of A) is true, A and B are independent. More formally, A and B are independent if P(A) = P(A|B).
                    <br>
                    Only independent events are really useful here, as they help to simplify things, as follows.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Theorem 0.6. Multiplication of Independent Events:</strong> P(A ∩ B) = P(A) · P(B).
                    <br>
                    Note that the above theorem holds only if we have independent events.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Remark 0.7:</strong> Independent ≠ Mutually Exclusive. Just because two events don’t affect each other doesn’t mean they can’t both happen and vice versa.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Example 0.8.</strong> In a drawer, Shreyas has 10 milk chocolates, 7 dark chocolates, and 5 caramel chocolates. He takes one out at random every day.
                    <br>
                    (a) If he eats the candy each day at school, what is the probability he eats dark chocolate two days in a row?
                    <br>
                    (b) If he forgets to eat the candy each day, then returning it back to the drawer, what is the probability he takes dark chocolate two days in a row?
                    <br>
                    <strong>Walkthrough:</strong>
                    <br>
                    (a) Are these events independent or dependent? Reason your way through it.
                    <br>
                    (b) Use the theorem above.
                    <br>
                    (c) Warning: The probabilities for day 2 are different in both parts.

                    <strong>Fundamental counting principle</strong>
                    <br>
                    If one event has m possible outcomes and a second event has n possible outcomes, then there are mn total possible outcomes for the two events together.

                    <br>
                    Order matters
                    <br>
                    <strong>Combinations</strong>
                    <br>
                    nCr=n! / r!(n-r)! for 0 ≤ r ≤ n
                    <br>
                    The number of combinations of n items in a set chosen r items at a time
                    <br>
                    Reads as “n choose r”
                    <br>
                    Order does not matter
                    <br>
                    <strong>Important:</strong> When seeing the word “and” in the context of a permutation or a combination, you multiply probabilities because they are dependent on each other. When seeing the word “or” in the context of a permutation or combination, you add individual probabilities because they are independent instances
                    <br>
                    <strong>Example:</strong> If a committee of five is selected at random from a group of 9 people (6 girls, 3 boys), what is the probability that it will have…
                    <br>
                    John and Mary as two of the 5 people?
                    <br>
                    1C1 * 1C1 * 7C3 = 35
                    <br>
                    9C5 = 126
                    <br>
                    35/126
                    <br>
                    Explanation: There is only one John and one Mary, so you are choosing 1 out of 1 twice and you are choosing 3 out of 7 for the remaining seats. Then, you multiply the probabilities because they are dependent on each other
                    <br>
                    Exactly 3 girls and 2 boys?
                    <br>
                    6C3 * 3C2 = 60
                    <br>
                    9C5 = 126
                    <br>
                    60/126 = 30/63
                    <br>
                    Explanation: Since you are choosing 3 girls out of 6 exactly, those are accounting for 3 of your seats while the remaining two have to be boys, choosing 2 out of 3. Then, you multiply the probabilities because they are dependent on each other
                    <br>
                    At least 3 girls?
                    <br>
                    (6C3 * 3C2) + (6C4 * 3C1) + (6C5 * 3C0) = 111
                    <br>
                    9C5 = 126
                    <br>
                    111/126
                    <br>
                    Explanation: There are multiple instances where you can choose at least 3 girls out of 5 because this accounts for the times you choose 3 girls, 4, or 5 for the 5 seats. These events are separate from each other, so you add their individual probabilities that you find by multiplying the chances of choosing a girl that many times by choosing the remaining seats from the boys that are remaining

                    <br>
                    <strong>m</strong> is for mean: the average of a distribution
                    <br>
                    <strong>o</strong> is for observation: the datapoint in question
                    <br>
                    <strong>s</strong> is for standard deviation: the relevant measure of distance here, used to determine how far an observation is from the mean (is a number equalling the approximate average distance of any given datapoint to the mean)
                    <br>
                    <strong>n</strong> is for normal distribution: a distribution which is roughly symmetrical and nicely mound shaped, for which the empirical rule applies
                    <br>
                    <strong>e</strong> is for empirical rule: a rule stating that in a normal distribution, 68% of values lie within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% within two, and 99.7% within three
                    <br>
                    <strong>z</strong> is for z-score: a measure of how many standard deviations away a given observational unit is from the mean: (observation - mean)/(standard deviation)
                    <br>
                    <strong>c</strong> is for calculus comparison using standardization: while you cannot compare observations of different distributions directly, you can first scale them by calculating their z-score and then compare them, giving a more accurate comparison
                    <br>
                    <strong>a</strong> is for area underneath the curve: calculus sometimes, you may want to approximate what percent of a normal distribution falls above, below, or within a certain range without being able to use the empirical rule - to do so, we can calculate the area under the curve as a percentage of the total area
                    <br>
                    <strong>p</strong> is for probabilities: using technology or a table, we can find the probability that any given observational unit lies within a z-score range (by expected value, this is also the approximate percentage of the normal distribution within the range)
                    <br>
                    <strong>i</strong> is for inverse: sometimes, we might want to go backwards - getting the z-score from a percentage. thankfully, technology has us covered again, and we can use the inverse norm function to find the z-score such that a given percentage of the normal distribution lies below it
                    <br>
                    <strong>g</strong> is for graphing calculator: use 2ND, VARS, 3 to pull up the invNorm function and enter the parameters of the area percentage, mean, and standard deviation to get the z-score with that area percentage below it. 
                    <br>
                    <strong>h</strong> is for hacks to figure out areas: 
                    <br>
                    1. the area percent above a certain z-score is equal to [1 - the area percent below it] (since the total area adds up to one)
                    <br>
                    2. the distribution is symmetric around the z-score of 0, so you can halve a symmetric area and halve the percentage
                    <br>
                    3. you can subtract - for example to get the area between 1 and 2 standard deviations you can take the area less than 2 and subtract the area less than 1
                    <br>
                    <strong>w</strong> is for wow you made it to the end of this: stay tuned for the other half of the alphabet next time (help i left myself all the bad letters)

                    <strong>Distinguishing characteristics of a normal distribution:</strong>
                    <br>
                    They are symmetric
                    <br>
                    They are mound-shaped
                    <br>
                    They follow a bell-shaped curve
                    <br>
                    On a TI-84, use the normalcdf function to find normal distribution probabilities:
                    <br>
                    Press [2nd] [VARS] [2] to open the function
                    <br>
                    Enter the lower boundary of the area you want
                    <br>
                    Enter the upper boundary
                    <br>
                    Enter the mean of the distribution (leave blank for 0)
                    <br>
                    Enter the standard deviation of the distribution (leave blank for 1)
                    <br>
                    If you use normalcdf, you must specify the mean and standard deviation when writing your final probability/area percentage
                    <br>
                    Ex., P(x&gt;2500)=0.0802 given that the mean = 3300 and the standard deviation = 570
                    <br>
                    There are 2 ways to check for population normality from sample data:
                    <br>
                    A normal probability plot (normal quantile plot) graphs the observed data against the expected theoretical data. If your data follows a roughly straight line on this plot, then it is approximately normal. This can be done by pasting your data into Rossman/Chance
                    <br>
                    You can also use your TI-84 to create a normal probability plot:
                    <br>
                    [STAT] [1] to open the list-edit screen
                    <br>
                    Cursor onto the label L1, then [CLEAR] [ENTER]
                    <br>
                    Enter all data values in L1
                    <br>
                    [2nd] [Y=] (makes STAT PLOT) [ENTER][ENTER]
                    <br>
                    [▼] [▶] [▶] [▶] [▶] [▶] [ENTER] [▼]

                    <br>
                    [ZOOM] [9] (makes ZoomStat)
                    <br>
                    Draw a parallel dot plot and boxplot of the data. If the data is approximately normal, the dotplot will be symmetric and mound-shaped, and the boxplot will also be symmetric. It is necessary to make and examine both plots
                    <br>
                    On a TI-84, you cannot create a parallel dotplot, so you can choose to make a histogram for comparison instead
                    <br>
                    Things to know (when using a normal probability table):
                    <br>
                    When you want to find the probability to the right of the z-score, subtract the probability to the left
                    <br>
                    When you want to find the probability between two values, subtract the probabilities from each other
                    <br>
                    If a z-score is too extreme to appear in the table, use a shaded sketch to determine whether the relevant probability is less than 0.0002 or greater than 0.9998

                    Possible sources of variation in a sampling distribution mean versus a population mean include<br>
                    Bias: if the sampling method was biased (eg not simple random sample)<br>
                    Chance Error: the unlikely but possible chance that the random samples have all turned out skewed a certain way<br>
                    Statistical Significance: (only applies when the other two do not) your sampling distribution mean is so different from the population mean that we cast doubt on the population mean<br>
                    A sample result is thus said to be statistically significant if the probability of that result occurring by pure chance is extremely low (usually &lt; 0.05)<br>
                    A result occurring that would occur by chance with probability &lt; 0.01 is highly significant<br>
                    Since we know by the CLT that sampling distributions tend to be normal if we have a large enough sample, we can use z-scores or the empirical rule to estimate the probability of something occurring<br>
                    The CLT gives us the mean and standard deviation for our sampling distribution, so we can calculate the probability of a normal distribution being above the particular z-score (if our sampling distribution mean is greater than the population mean) or below (if our sampling distribution mean is less than the population mean)<br>
                    Statistical confidence is how close you expect a sample distribution statistic to come to the corresponding population parameter, determined by the sample size (since this determines sample distribution standard deviation) and how confident you would like to be (how many z-scores away your interval needs to be)<br>
                    Ensure CLT is applicable before applying it<br>
                    You must either have a normal population distribution or n &gt;= 30<br>

                    Test of Significance<br>
                    Give a description of the parameter, being sure to identify the type of number (e.g.., a mean or a proportion), the variable, and the population<br>
                    Example: The parameter of interest is the average time in seconds that a student estimated elapsed while the clip of "ABC" was played. Using μ to represent it<br>
                    State competing claims about the parameter of interest. The null hypothesis states the parameter is equal to a specific value<br>
                    H0: parameter = hypothesized value (statement of no effect)<br>
                    Example: H0: μ = 10<br>
                    The alternative hypothesis states what the researchers suspect or hope to be true about the parameter. The form of the alternative hypothesis is determined by the research question before the samples are collected<br>
                    Ha: parameter < hypothesized value<br>
                    Ha: parameter > hypothesized value<br>
                    Ha: parameter ≠ hypothesized value<br>
                    Specify the behavior of the sampling distribution under the null hypothesis. Typically involving checking some technical conditions that need to be met, such as the Central Limit Theorem. The initial two important conditions to check are a simple random sample (SRS) and the sample size/normality of the distribution. Conditions will be checked assuming the null hypothesis is true<br>
                    Conditions for CLT:<br>
                    Simple random sample (assumed implemented if unmentioned)<br>
                    n > 30 (If false, check if the distribution is normally distributed. If not normally distribution, proceed with caution)<br>
                    Independent where n < 10% of overall population size (assume that it is independent but make sure to state this in conditions)<br>
                    Draw a well-labeled sketch with a mean of the hypothesized value and a standard deviation of s√n, where s is the standard deviation of the sample. Also mark the observed mean value of your sample<br>
                    Calculate a test statistic to measure the discrepancy between the observed statistic and the hypothesized value of the parameter. If the discrepancy is large, we have evidence against a null hypothesis<br>
                    The test statistic can be found by seeing how many standard deviations the sample mean is away from the population mean<br>
                    t =  x-μs/√n <br>
                    Calculate the p-value, which is the probability, assuming the null hypothesis to be true, of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one actually observed. Extreme meaning “in the direction of the alternative hypothesis.”<br>
                    An alternative hypothesis of “not equal” means that you need the probability in both tails<br>
                    A positive t-statistic indicates finding the probability above it in the t-distribution with the degrees of freedom. You then multiply that by 2 in order to calculate the probability in both tails (done with a t-table or a calculator)<br>
                    Summarize your conclusion in context. State a test decision or a comment evaluating the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis where the test decision needs to be made.<br>
                    If the p-value is small, reject the null hypothesis<br>
                    p-value below 0.05 but above 0.01 constitutes reasonably strong evidence against the null hypothesis<br>
                    p-value below 0.01 constitutes very strong evidence against the null hypothesis<br>
                    If the p-value is high, do not reject the null hypothesis<br>
                    p-value above .10 constitutes little to no evidence against the null hypothesis<br>
                    p-value below 0.10 but above 0.05 constitutes moderately strong evidence against the null hypothesis<br>
                    In some studies, the researcher can decide in advance how small the p-value needs to be to support a null hypothesis. This cutoff is called a significance level, denoted by 𝞪. A smaller significance level indicates stricter standards. If a researcher specifies a level of significance in advance, you have to say you fail or reject the hypothesis at a certain level.<br>
                    Another common expression is to say that the data are statistically significant if it is unlikely to have occurred by chance or sampling variability alone.<br>
                    Proceed with responding to the research question and whether you have evidence for the alternative hypothesis or not (restate final conclusions towards research question)<br>
                    Hypotheses are always about parameters, not statistics<br>
                    The alternative hypothesis should be composed before data is collected (unbiased)<br>
                    The denominator of a test statistic is the standard error denoted by s√n<br>
                    When calculating the p-value for a two-sided alternative, include the total area in both tails of the t-distribution beyond the value of the test statistic. You can calculate this total area by doubling the area in the right tail.<br>
                    A low p-value indicates strong evidence against a null hypothesis<br>
                    You cannot generalize to a larger population if the sample was not random, in which case you can generalize to smaller, more representative populations<br>
