                experiments vs observational studies:
                experiments impose treatment (do things to find new data)
                observational studies do not impose treatment (passively record existing data)
                observational studies cannot be used to establish a cause and effect relationship, only experiments can (to see the response, we must impose the change)
                observational studies can still be useful, as they establish a relationship between the two variables (but not necessarily a cause-effect one)
                sampling vocab:
                parameter is a measure of a whole population
                statistic is a measure of a sample of a population
                a sample is representative when it is able to represent the population
                sample size is the number of observational units in a sample
                sampling frame is a list of observational units in the population to select from
                homogenous means that the population is overall uniform, and any sample is representative
                simple random sampling (srs) is a method of sampling where every member in the population is given an equal chance, which generally creates a representative sample
                types of bias:
                convenience sampling: only choosing people convenient to get
                voluntary response sampling: letting people choose to be part of the sample or not
                undercoverage bias: the way you choose your sample underrepresents a part of the population
                non-response bias: when people selected as part of the sample refuse
                response bias: the way you survey or select the sample influences responses
                wording bias: confusing wording leads to confusion
                lurking variables:
                def: a variable that could influence the response variable, yet is not the explanatory variable
                confounding: when two variables are so interconnected that you cannot distinguish their effects
                
                
                Example of parameter versus statistic: Of all U.S. kindergarten teachers, 32% say that knowing the alphabet is an essential skill. Of the 800 U.S. kindergarten teachers polled, 34% say that knowing the alphabet is an essential skill

                A quality control engineer at a factory that produces TVs selects 10 TV's from the production line each hour for 8 hours
                Population: refers to the entire broad thing being studied; All TVs at this factory
                Sample: refers to the small part taken from the sample in the experiment or study; Randomly selected TVs from production line
                Sample size: amount of things sampled; 80 TVs
                Prior to an election, a local news organization surveys 1000 registered voters to predict which candidate will be elected as governor
                Population: All registered voters in that state
                Sample: 1000 voters that are surveyed
                Sample size: 1000
                Of the U.S. population, 36% have an allergy. A sample of 1200 randomly selected adults resulted in 33.2% reporting an allergy.
                What is the population and its parameter value?
                The population is U.S. citizens and the parameter is 36% having an allergy.
                What is the sample and its statistics value?
                The sample is the 1200 citizens selected and the statistic is 33.2% having an allergy
                Why are parameters fixed and statistics variable?
                Parameters describe the whole population and that population's data stays stagnant. Statistics are variable because different samples will result in slightly different statistics due to sampling variability

                One study of cell phones and the risk of brain cancer looked at a group of 469 people who have brain cancer. The investigators matched each cancer patient with a person of the same age, sex, and race who did not have brain cancer, then asked about the use of cell phones. Result: Our data suggests that the use of hand-held cellular phones are not associated with risk of brain cancer
                Is this an observational study or an experiment?
                It is an observational study as they are not imposing treatment on the subjects
                What is the explanatory variable? Response variable?
                The explanatory variable is cell phone use
                The response variable is whether you get brain cancer
                Based on this study, would you conclude that cell phones do not increase the risk of brain cancer? Why or why not?
                You cannot conclude this as it was an observational study and you cannot draw cause and effect conclusions
                Even though cause and effect relationships cannot be drawn from an observational study, how can it still help researchers?
                It can help them find associations between two variables and create an experiment based on that result

                Sampling bias: When a sample of a population is collected in a way all members of the population do not have an equal sampling probability (chance of being sampled)
                Simple random sampling: A type of probability sampling in which a subset of a population is randomly selected for data collection. All members of the population must have an equal chance of being sampled
                Random digit tables, calculators, and computers are good impersonal methods to select a random sample
                Using a random digits table:
                Decide the number of digits being looked for each time
                When under 10 items in the population, look for single digits (0-9)
                When under 100 items, look for 2 digits (00-99)
                When under 1000 items, look for 3 digits (000-999)
                Start at any point in the table and read the digits based on the number decided in step 1
                E.g., if a population has 78 items, look for digits 01-78 (skip 00 and 79-99)
                Depending on the situation, you might skip repeat selections
                Show your work by circling/underlining digits being selected and crossing out digits being skipped
                Sample size refers to how many observational units are in a sample
                In an actual study, you should only take one sample from a given population
                If your sampling method is biased, taking a larger sample will not reduce the bias, but produce a more precise estimate that is still inaccurate to the population value
                If you are working with a truly random sample, it is reasonable to draw conclusions about a population from its sample
                The larger a sample, the more precise its statistics are 
                Precision is how close the data points are to each other
                Sample size affects the precision of a sample
                Accuracy is how close the data points are to the accepted/predicted value
                Bias (or the lack of bias) affects the accuracy of a sample
                
                
                If you are not working with a random sample, what can you not do confidently?
                You cannot say that the sample is representative of the population
                If your sampling method is biased and you take a larger sample you will _____ reduce the bias and you will produce a more _____ estimate that is still not close to the population value.

                Anecdotal evidence: results of situations that come to mind easily, but have little to no use in scientific research. Statistics tries to avoid anecdotal evidence
                Experiment: study that treatment is actively imposed by the experimenter on subjects. Ideally, subjects are all identical other than the explanatory variable
                Random Assignment: preferred way of assigning subjects treatment to avoid confounding variables. Each subject has an equal chance of being assigned any treatment group. Study is called a randomized comparative experiment.
                It is often helpful to diagram an experiment using an experimental design diagram.
                Observational unit —> (arrows from observational to treatment indicate random assignment) —> Treatment 1 or Treatment 2 —> Compare results (mean or proportion)
                
                Comparison: Use a design to compare two or more treatments
                Random assignment: use chance to assign experimental units to treatments to create roughly equivalent groups of observational units by balancing the effects of other variables among treatment groups
                Control: Keeps other variables (excluding explanatory) the same for all groups, especially variables that are likely to affect response variable
                Replication: Uses enough experimental units in each group so that any difference in the effects of the treatments can be distinguished from chance difference between groups
                Blindness: experimental units are not aware of the experiment being done and the group that they are assigned to avoid outside influences
                Double blindness is when the experimenter also does not know the treatment assignments
                Random sampling aims to produce a sample that is representative of the population. Random sampling eliminates bias.
                Random assignment aims to produce treatment groups that are similar in all respects except for the treatments imposed. Random assignment eliminates confounding
                Blocking (W9D2 PKC)
                3 easy steps to fix your confounding variables!!!
                are you running a medical survey or similar? worried about dumb patients “feeling better” just because they got “helped”? try placebos! make everyone feel the same way by changing as little as possible between control groups
                stupid patients and researchers letting judgment get in the way? BLIND THEM!!! don't tell patients which control group their part of of (single blind) and now that i think about it don't tell researchers either (double blind)
                really paranoid about a specific confounding variable??? BLOCK THEM!!! separate your observational units into homogenous blocks by lurking variables first, then randomize groups and compare within each block - no more confounding guaranteed!
                um yeah infomercial done
                a design without blocking is a “completely randomized design”
                a design with blocking is a “randomized block design”
                
                one sample, two sample, matched pairs
                one sample: collect one piece of data (one sample wow) from each observational unit
                then see if the sample statistics show anything meaningfully significant (1 sample test)
                two sample: split your observational units into groups then take a piece of data from each group, but calculate statistics for each group
                compare to see if there is a significant difference between the two (2 sample test)
                matched pairs: collect two pieces of data from the same observational unit (usually an intrinsically paired observational unit or a before and after type situation)
                analyze the differences between the two pieces of data as a statistic for significance (paired test)
                What does blocking eliminate in an experiment?
                Blocking helps eliminate confounding variables
